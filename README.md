# Cryptography
This repository aims to be my personal practical guide to the [Coursera's Cryptography I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) 
course by Dan Boneh (University of Stanford). It contains some well-known cipher implementations and attacks, many of them were made 
to solve the programming assignments of the course.

## Running dependencies
All the codes are written in **Python 3** and some of them use the [PyCryptodome](https://www.pycryptodome.org) module, so they are the only prequisites.

## Instructions
Please refer to the readme inside each folder.
